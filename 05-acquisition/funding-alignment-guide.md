# Funding Alignment Guide: Matching Scope to Incremental Funding

## 1. Concept
The Counter-SUAS IDIQ model is designed to match project scope to incoming funding streams. This allows the customer to scale protection based on budget availability without restarting the acquisition process.

## 2. Incremental Phasing
Work is divided into "climbable" milestones that provide value even if funding is paused:

| Milestone | Scope | Funding Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **P1: Site Survey & Design** | Conceptual design, sensor mapping | Seed/Initial Funding |
| **P2: Long-Lead Items** | Ordering critical sensors/effectors | Procurement Funds |
| **P3: Base Deployment** | Core "Detection & Alerting" capability | Execution Funds |
| **P4: Full Capability** | Integration of effectors and multi-site C2 | Final/Expansion Funds |

## 3. Task Order Modification
- **Additive Scope**: If additional funding becomes available (e.g., mid-FY), a modification to the Task Order can be issued to add extra sensors or capability layers.
- **De-scoping**: If funding is restricted, the framework allows for "parking" the project at a safe state (e.g., keeping only detection sensors active).

## 4. Best Practices
- **Standardized WBS**: Use a common Work Breakdown Structure to compare integrator costs across different task orders.
- **Matched Milestones**: Ensure payment milestones align with physical delivery of hardware or verified system performance.

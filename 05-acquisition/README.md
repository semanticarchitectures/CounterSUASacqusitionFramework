# 05-Acquisition: Procurement and Contract Strategies

## Integration with DOD Acquisition
This framework links technical requirements directly to contract actions.

- **IDIQ (Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity)**: Primary pathway for site-specific acquisition, enabling rapid task orders from a pool of pre-approved suppliers.
- **Multiple Integrator Model**: Fostering competition for specific sites (Airports, Convoys, etc.) while ensuring all proposals conform to the common SE framework.
- **Vendor Agnosticism**: Standardized interfaces and common requirements to simplify the bidding process across different integrator capabilities.
- **Lifecycle Management**: SE support for upgrades and maintenance across the IDIQ vehicle as threats evolve.

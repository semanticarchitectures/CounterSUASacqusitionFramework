# Integrator Prequalification Criteria

## 1. Purpose
This document defines baseline eligibility criteria for integrators bidding on Counter-SUAS task orders under the IDIQ vehicle.

## 2. Minimum Eligibility
- **Relevant Experience**: Demonstrated delivery of C2, sensor fusion, or air-defense systems in the last 5 years.
- **Open Architecture Compliance**: Evidence of integration with open standards (e.g., OMS, CMOSS, or equivalent).
- **Cybersecurity Readiness**: Ability to support RMF compliance and deliver Authority to Operate (ATO) artifacts.
- **Manufacturing Capacity**: Ability to scale production and deployment within defined task-order timelines.

## 3. Performance Evidence
- **Past Performance**: At least two references for comparable system deployments.
- **Test Results**: Lab or field test data for detection, classification, and mitigation performance.
- **Quality Management**: Documented QA/QC processes (e.g., ISO 9001 or equivalent).

## 4. Documentation Requirements
- **Compliance Matrix**: Mapping to the Common System Requirements Document (CSRD).
- **Integration Plan**: Description of sensor/effector integration approach and interface assumptions.
- **Sustainment Plan**: Approach for updates, spares, and lifecycle support.

## 5. Disqualifiers
- **Non-Compliant Interfaces**: Proprietary-only interfaces without documented APIs.
- **Security Gaps**: Inability to meet baseline cybersecurity requirements.

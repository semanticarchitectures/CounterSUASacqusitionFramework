# Cost Estimating Framework: C-SUAS Site Implementations

## 1. Overview
This framework provides a standardized approach for estimating the costs of tailored Counter-SUAS solutions under the IDIQ contract vehicle. It ensures transparency and allows for better comparison between different integrator bids.

## 2. Cost Categories (WBS)
### 2.1 Hardware (Procurement)
- **Sensors**: Radar, EO/IR, RF sensors, Acoustic arrays.
- **Effectors**: Electronic Warfare (EW) modules, Kinetic Interceptors, Directed Energy components.
- **C2 Infrastructure**: Servers, workstations, networking hardware.
- **Support Equipment**: Mounts, enclosures, power supply systems.

### 2.2 Integration & Testing
- **Systems Engineering**: Requirements management, site-specific design.
- **Software Integration**: API development, sensor fusion tuning.
- **Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)**: Initial verification before shipping.
- **On-Site Integration**: Installation and cabling.

### 2.3 Site-Specific Implementation
- **Site Survey**: Geographical and RF analysis.
- **Civil Works**: Foundations, towers, electrical installation.
- **Operational Readiness Testing (ORT)**: On-site verification.

### 2.4 Lifecycle Costs
- **O&M (Operations & Maintenance)**: Annual support, software updates.
- **Training**: Training packages for site personnel.
- **Sustainment**: Spare parts and hardware refreshes.

## 3. Estimation Methods
- **Parametric Estimating**: Using historical costs from similar site profiles (e.g., cost per km of coverage).
- **Vendor Quotes**: Direct pricing for specific modular components.
- **Engineering Estimate**: Bottom-up calculation for unique site civil works or integration challenges.

## 4. Cost Scaling Factors
- **Geography**: Remote sites vs. urban centers (logistics and labor costs).
- **Threat Level**: Scaling the quantity and sensitivity of sensors.
- **Asset Criticality**: Requirements for redundancy and hardened systems.

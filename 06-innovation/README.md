# 06-Innovation: Technology Trajectory & Evolving Capabilities

## 1. Overview
The C-SUAS threat landscape evolves faster than traditional acquisition cycles. This section provides a framework for estimating the trajectory of SUAS technology and defining strategies for the rapid acquisition of counter-measures.

## 2. Technology Trajectory Estimation
To stay ahead of the threat, the framework tracks several key technology vectors:

### 2.1 Autonomy & Swarming
- **Trajectory**: Shift from single, operator-controlled drones to fully autonomous, collaborative swarms.
- **Counter-Strategy**: Requirements for high-bandwidth sensing and C2 capable of processing multi-target engagements simultaneously.

### 2.2 Low-Observable / Stealth
- **Trajectory**: Use of composite materials and radar-absorbent coatings on small platforms.
- **Counter-Strategy**: Multi-modal sensor fusion (Acoustic, EO/IR) to compensate for reduced radar cross-sections.

### 2.3 Hardened Communications & GNSS-Denied Nav
- **Trajectory**: Resilience against traditional jamming through frequency hopping or optical links; navigation via visual odometry or inertial sensors instead of GPS.
- **Counter-Strategy**: Investment in non-kinetic "takeover" technologies and kinetic precision-interceptors that do not rely on RF disruption.

## 3. Acquiring Evolving Capabilities
The acquisition model must support the rapid insertion of "vNext" technology.

### 3.1 Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA)
- Ensuring all IDIQ task orders mandate standardized interfaces (APIs), allowing a "sensor-of-the-month" or "effector-of-the-month" replacement without rebuilding the C2 infrastructure.

### 3.2 Technology Refresh Cycles
- Establishing 12–18 month technical refresh cycles within the IDIQ for critical software modules and sensor hardware.

### 3.3 Rapid Prototyping & Pilot Task Orders
- Using small-scale Task Orders to benchmark emerging technologies at specific test sites before full-scale deployment across the high-value asset network.

## 4. Innovation Roadmap
- **Near-Term (0-12 Months)**: Integration of AI/ML for automated threat classification.
- **Mid-Term (1-3 Years)**: Deployment of collaborative sensor networks for wide-area city protection.
- **Long-Term (3+ Years)**: Transition to fully autonomous, networked C-SUAS defenses for mobile convoy protection.

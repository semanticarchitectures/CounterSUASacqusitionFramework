# Asset Protection Profile: Mobile Convoy

## 1. Environment Overview
- **Asset Type**: Mobile Asset.
- **Geography**: Dynamic; varying terrain (urban, rural, highway).
- **Constraints**: Motion-induced vibration, power limitations, limited crew for system operation.

## 2. Specific Requirements
- **Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP)**: Must be vehicle-mountable without significant impact on vehicle performance or payload.
- **Rapid Deployment**: System must be operational within 3 minutes of vehicle start or halt.
- **Automated Self-Protection**:
    - **Requirement**: Automated "bubble" protection.
    - **Effectors**: Low-power Electronic Warfare (EW) or point-defense kinetic options (where ROE permits).
- **Alerting**: Audio-visual alerts for drivers and security personnel.

## 3. Command and Control (C2)
- Distributed C2 across the convoy to allow for "leader-follower" system management.
- Integration with vehicle navigation and situational awareness systems.

## 4. Mobile Customization
- **Geography**: Sensors must compensate for vehicle pitch, roll, and heading changes during movement.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Optimized for immediate self-preservation over long-range identification.

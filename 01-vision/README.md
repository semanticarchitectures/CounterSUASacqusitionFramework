# 01-Vision: Counter-SUAS Mission and Philosophy

## Mission Statement
To provide an agile systems engineering framework that accelerates the acquisition of tailored C-SUAS solutions, ensuring that every asset—from a single aircraft to a major metropolitan area—is protected by a system optimized for its unique geographic and threat context.

## The Challenge
C-SUAS is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Solutions are constrained by:
- **Geography**: Urban canyons vs. open deserts.
- **Local Restrictions**: Radio frequency limitations, kinetic restrictions.
- **Risk Tolerance**: Difference between a civil airport and a remote military outpost.
- **Threat Dynamism**: Rapidly evolving drone capabilities and tactics.

## Core Philosophy
1. **Decoupling**: Separate the *requirement* (what needs protection) from the *solution* (sensors/effectors).
2. **Customization at Scale**: Use standardized SE building blocks to build bespoke systems.
3. **Data-Driven Acquisition**: Link technical performance modeling directly to contract actions.

## Strategic Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Framework Initialization & Asset Taxonomy (Current).
- **Phase 2**: Requirements Mapping & Modular Architecture Definitions.
- **Phase 3**: Performance Modeling & Acquisition Template Integration.
- **Phase 4**: Pilot Implementation (e.g., Airfield Protection Demo).

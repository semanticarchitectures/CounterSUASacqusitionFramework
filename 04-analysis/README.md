# 04-Analysis: Performance and Risk Assessment

This directory contains modeling tools and analysis templates.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Time to Detect**: Minimum time from threat launch to system alert.
- **Probability of Identification (PID)**: Confidence level in target classification.
- **False Alarm Rate (FAR)**: Number of non-threat alerts per hour (critical for urban/airport sites).
- **Engagement Success Rate**: Probability of neutralising a threat within the protected volume.

## Analysis Templates
- **Geographical Constraint Assessment**: Identifying line-of-sight gaps in urban or mountainous terrain.
- **RF Spectrum Analysis**: Managing interference with local communications.
- **Risk Tolerance Matrix**: Balancing protection levels against operational costs and collateral risk.

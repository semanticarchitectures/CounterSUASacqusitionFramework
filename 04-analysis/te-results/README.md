# Test & Evaluation (T&E) Results

This directory centralizes findings, data, and analysis from specific C-sUAS testing events.

## Structure

Events are organized by date and location (e.g., `2026-Q1-WhiteSands/`). Each event folder contains:

- `event-summary.md`: High-level overview of test objectives, environmental conditions, and participating vendors.
- `raw-data/`: Directory for logs, telemetry, and unprocessed sensor streams.
- `performance-metrics.json`: Evaluated KPIs (Pd, Pk, latency) mapped to specific components and scenarios.

## Data Governance

Ensure all PII and sensitive vendor proprietary data is handled according to the program's security guidelines.

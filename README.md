# Counter-SUAS Systems Engineering Framework

Strategic framework for the acquisition and customization of counter-drone systems to protect diverse high-value assets.

## Overview

This repository provides a modular systems engineering approach to tailoring Counter-Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-SUAS) solutions. By decoupling asset types, threat profiles, and mitigation strategies, the framework ensures that defense requirements are optimized for specific operational environments.

### Core Objectives
1. **Asset-Specific Protection**: Custom requirements for airfields, cities, convoys, ships, and personnel.
2. **Modular Architecture**: Interchangeable C2, sensor suites, and effectors.
3. **Optimized Performance**: balancing early threat identification against false alarm rates.
4. **Acquisition Support**: Integration with DOD procurement strategies (e.g., UCA plans for long-lead items).

## Framework Structure

- **[01-vision/](file:///Users/kevinkelly/workspace/counterSUAS/01-vision/)**: Mission statement, philosophy, and strategic roadmap.
- **[02-requirements/](file:///Users/kevinkelly/workspace/counterSUAS/02-requirements/)**: Modular requirement sets categorized by asset and risk tolerance.
- **[03-architecture/](file:///Users/kevinkelly/workspace/counterSUAS/03-architecture/)**: SE models for C2 integration and system-of-systems interaction.
- **[04-analysis/](file:///Users/kevinkelly/workspace/counterSUAS/04-analysis/)**: Performance modeling, risk analysis, and geographical constraint templates.
- **[05-acquisition/](file:///Users/kevinkelly/workspace/counterSUAS/05-acquisition/)**: Procurement guides, UCA templates, and vendor management.

## Key Principles
- **Early Identification**: Maximizing "left-of-launch" and early-flight detection.
- **Low False Alarm Rate**: Essential for high-density environments (cities/airports).
- **Scalability**: Scaling from convoy self-protection to regional defense.
